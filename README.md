Exploring Neural Networks using Sci-Kit Learn and TensorFlow

Some of my early attempts to understand the Neural Networks model as a learning tool.

IrisClassifier explores the possibility of finding non-linear relations between the features and the class values. It uses Sci-Kit Learn's MLPClassifier It uses a 2 layer Deep Feed-Forward Neural Network for classification. The data is divided into 120 training samples, which contains 40 samples of each flower type, and 30 test samples, which consists of 10 samples of each flower type. While testing period too, the network learns. It uses backpropergation algorithm with optimizer (adam) for learning. Its accuracy varies from 97% to 100%.
